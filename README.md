Gym Calorie Prediction Using Linear Regression
Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the calories burned by gym users during their workouts. Using a Kaggle dataset, the goal is to develop a linear regression model that accurately estimates calorie expenditure based on various user features and workout characteristics.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains data on gym users, including features such as:

User Weight: The weight of the user in kilograms.
Workout Type: The type of workout performed (e.g., Yoga, HIIT, Cardio, Strength).
Session Duration: Duration of the workout session in minutes.
Heart Rate Metrics: Various metrics, including maximum and average beats per minute (BPM).
Calories Burned: The target variable representing calories burned during the workout.
